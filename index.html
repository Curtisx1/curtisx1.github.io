        <h2>Professional Bio</h2>
        <p>
            I am a dedicated and experienced Technical Support Specialist pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science 
            and a minor in Mathematics from the University of Missouri - Kansas City. I also have a background in Communications 
            with an emphasis on Web & Interactive Media from Pittsburg State University.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am proficient in Python, C/C++, and PowerShell, and have experience with various tools and frameworks such as 
            Git, GitHub, Postman, RESTful API, Visual Studio & VS Code, AWS (S3, Lambda), Jira, and Docker.
        </p>
        <p>
            In my roles at MHC Kenworth and ScriptPro, I have demonstrated my ability to provide professional and proactive 
            support for all technical aspects of the business, manage large-scale projects, and design, create, and implement 
            programs to automate internal processes. I have also shown my ability to support and maintain remote locations across 
            the US, addressing issues related to PC hardware, software, and robotic systems.
        </p>
        <p>
            I have a track record of improving internal processes, writing internal training documentation, and developing training 
            materials. My project, LIA (A dashboard and automation program), showcases my ability to automate processes using Python and Powershell. 
            I am a problem-solver who is always ready to take on new challenges and continuously strives to improve and streamline solutions.

        <h2>Education Background</h2>
        <p>I initially attended Pittsburg State University majoring in communication with an emphasis in web and interactive media. 
        I ended up leaving and not completing that degree. After a few years of working in technical support positions, I realized I really enjoyed programming 
        and enrolled at UMKC majoring in Computer Science with a minor in math. </p>
