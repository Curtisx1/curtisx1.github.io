            This was a project that snowballed into a giant learning experience and is FAR from complete. It has produced some really nice flowers and herbs though!
        </p>
        <p>
            Spring of 2023 I put together a greenhouse with no plans and no end goal. 
            Made of corrugated plastic, mylar reflective sheeting, glass panels, tape, glue, screws, and a small folding table, I had a fairly solid greenhouse in my office. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Problems began when due to poor ventilation and weak lighting. I added more grow lights and an automatic timer plugged into an outlet. 
            For the ventilation I added an old PC fan. How do I power this fan automatically? Which led to the Arduinoâ€¦

    <!-- Overview Section -  Problems! -->
    <div class="section" id="overview">
        <h2>Problems...</h2>
        <p style="text-align: center;">This is really a hobby project, which means it has a lot of problems right now.</p>
        
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Invalid data results</strong></li>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The main issue I am fighting is invalid data values from my sensors. I have 4 humidity and temperature sensors. In general the data is accurate but
                        sometimes I get invalid results such as readings of 120C for temperature which I doubt are accurate. When this happens, it triggers the exhaust fan when 
                        it is not required. From researching, this is most likely due to the cheap sensors used. I am working towards replacing them with higher quality Bosch sensors.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            <li><strong>Error handling</strong></li>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Being new to Arduino and embedded programming, it has been hard to recover from errors. So far I have had to physically reset the microcontroller. Currently,
                    working to add a logging file to track errors.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <li><strong>Camera issues</strong></li>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    I had to get a special cable for data transfer and capture on my PC using Python. I also had to get an external power supply for the camera. Right now
                    I am having issues with focus. As the humidity rises in the greenhouse and the plants grow, the focus is shifted and is hard to fix.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <li><strong>Hardware setup/design</strong></li>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    At this point in my greenhouse journey, I really want to rebuild it. I had <i>no intentions</i> of fully automating growing plants. The physical limitations
                    and size are holding me back. 
                </li>
            </ul>
            <li><strong>Plant issues!</strong></li>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Growing plants is easy! Until its not. Some of my plants LOVE humidity and higher temperatures, others do not. Balancing the right levels and making sure
                    each plant is happy has been a Balancing act.

        <h2>Future Plans</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Fully automated watering system (I have the sensor, pump, hosing, and nozzles!)</li>
            <li>Rebuild the physical structure to accommodate the above.</li>
            <li>Fully build out the Arduino IOT dashboard. Mostly built at this point</li>
