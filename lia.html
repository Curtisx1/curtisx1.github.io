        <p>
            Working in technical support, you do the same things over and over again… a LOT. 
            There were two things I had to do multiple times a day. 
        </p>
        <p style="margin-left: 12em;">
            1.	Listen to voicemails left in an Outlook inbox from callers and transcribe them into a Jira ticket.<br>
            2.	Assign out tickets to the team that were opening via email or from the above voicemail process.

        </p>
        <p>
            On a busy day this could easily be 50+ tickets combined. I was sick of it. 
            I knew we could do better and that I could create a tool that would automatically do this with no user intervention.
            I started reading into Jira’s API. I had no idea what I was doing and was not sure it would even work.
        </p>
        <p>
            Originally, I had one function written in Python that would simply make a ticket based on information I had manually typed in. This was just the start. 
            Eventually the program ballooned into a GUI written in TKinter. Which I was really happy with, for about a day. 
            Tkinter is great for super simple GUI’s but falls short with the sort of features I needed to make this a 100% uptime automation GUI dashboard. 
            I rewrote the entire program using PyQT for the GUI and LIA (Lemke’s Internal Automation) was born.
            A 65” inch TV displays my GUI for our technical support team to view and it has been creating and assigning tickets for over a year now.

        <h2>Stats and Outcomes</h2>
        <p>Over the past year LIA has run almost 24/7 creating tickets and assigning them out when a tech is available.</p>
        <p style="text-align: center;">
            Here are the stats so far:
        </p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Tickets created from emails: </strong>3476</li>
            <li><strong>Tickets created from voicemails: </strong>5130</li>
            <li><strong>Total tickets created and assigned: </strong>8606</li>
            <li><strong>Time saved: </strong>717 hours (based on 5 minutes average to create and assign the ticket)</li>
            <li><strong>Money saved: </strong>$14,340 (based on $20 an hour per tech)</li>
            <li><strong>Time to ticket resolution: </strong>Reduced from 1 hour 25 minutes to less than 45 minutes.</li>
        </ul>

    <!-- Overview Section -  Problems! -->
    <div class="section" id="overview">
        <h2>Problems...</h2>
        <p style="text-align: center;">If I listed all of them here, this page would scroll for days. I chose the top 5 problems.</p>
        
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Assigning tickets out evenly</strong></li>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        We have a team of 8 people, they all come in at staggered times, leave for lunch at different times,
                        and leave for the day at different times. They may also be on PTO and not present for the day.
                        I had to account for all of these factors. I implemented a weighted system that will only assign a ticket
                        to the user with the lowest weight.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            <li><strong>Error handling</strong></li>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    This is still a work in progress. Trying to catch and recover from all possible errors has proven to be a 
                    weekly task. The GUI used to crash MULTIPLE times a day. It now can run 24/7 without crashing and correctly logs the error. 
                    I have yet to run into a new error at this point. Still working on recovering from losing network access.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <li><strong>Auto-start and Auto-stop</strong></li>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    We do not want the auto-unassign feature running after hours. Adding a new thread that checks the time and starts it at
                    6:30AM and stops it at 6:00PM proved to be a challenge. I am happy to say it now works flawlessly.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <li><strong>Counter resets based on day/week/month</strong></li>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Testing the counter resets was difficult and not full proof. I am still chasing down a reason on why the week/month 
                    does not reset properly <i>sometimes.</i>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <li><strong>Multi-threading</strong></li>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Multi-threading was an all new concept to me when first working with PyQt5. I spend a solid week trying to figure out why
                    elements in my GUI were not updating, only to learn about the "socket and slot" methods for updating main GUI elements.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </ol>
